Hello, individual! You're probably a human.
Humans are very capable. Capable enough to make a system used in somewhat primitive 3D games like Doom - a system that took me around 3/4ths of a week to understand. Maybe you'll do better.

Anyways, here's the task.
Using **NO AI** you must __create a proper BSP (binary space partitioning) tree creation and traversal system__ *from scratch, with no code copy and pasted from the internet, and no loopholing any rules*. You can do this in any programming language. If you can't code and can't even use block based languages like Scratch, then write something of decent length (like a page or two AT MOST and probably like 200-400 words in actuality) that basically explains it. *IN YOUR OWN WORDS*

Good luck! Remember that no one is actually forcing you to do this. It would be really funny and you'd also learn something if you did, though. So, ignoring the time spent on it, why not?

---
For bonus points, also write a 3D renderer using your traversal system. EVEN MORE POINTS IF IT HAS TEXTURE MAPPING!!!
No external libraries other than ones used to do actual rendering. So, no numpy or anything like that, unless these libraries are __strictly__ required for what you're doing. Again, no loopholing this.

oh yeah also I did pretty much this, but with a pretty much undocumented (and very buggy) micropython implementation on the HP Prime. ~~I did use AI for some of it though,~~ but I didn't blindly copy and paste. good luck ig lol
